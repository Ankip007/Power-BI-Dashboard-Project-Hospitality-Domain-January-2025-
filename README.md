# Power BI Dashboard Project â€“ Hospitality Domain January 2025:
## Project Objective
Developed an interactive dashboard visualizing key hospitality KPIs to support operational and strategic decisions.
Tracked No-Show Bookings and No-Show Rate (%) to monitor booking reliability.
Analyzed Booking % by Platform and Room Class for channel and segment insights.
Calculated ADR, Realisation %, and RevPAR to assess revenue performance.
 Monitored DBRN, DSRN, and DURN for occupancy by room type.
 Visualized WoW Changes in Revenue, Occupancy, and ADR to identify trends
 Tools: Power BI, DAX, Excel.
 
## Dataset used

## Questions (KPIs)
To get the total revenue_realized
-To get the total number of bookings happened
-To get the total capacity of rooms present in hotels
-To get the total succesful bookings happened for all hotels
-Occupancy means total successful bookings happened to the
-total rooms available(capacity)
-Get the average ratings given by the customers
-To get the total number of days present in the data.
-In our case, we have data from May to July. So 92 days.
-To get the"Cancelled" bookings out of all Total bookings
happened
-calculating the cancellaton percentage.
-To get the successful 'Checked out' bookings out of all Total
bookings happened

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insight
-High No-Show Rate on Specific Days/Platforms:
-Booking Preferences by Platform and Room Class:
-ADR and Revenue Trends:
-Realisation % Variance:
-Room Occupancy Distribution (DBRN, DSRN, DURN):
-Week-over-Week Trends:


## Final Conclusion:

-The dashboard enabled data-driven strategies that improved revenue visibility, highlighted high-risk no-show patterns, and optimized room pricing and promotion timing.

Key areas for business improvement include:

-Enhancing customer reliability via pre-confirmation nudges or incentives

-Adjusting platform-specific pricing to reduce no-shows

-Improving Realisation % through better discount control

-Focusing marketing on high-ADR, high-occupancy room types

-Overall, the project demonstrated the power of centralized performance tracking in driving strategic hospitality decisions.
